## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, using the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library to work with date and time.

### Features:
* Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner. 
* Presents time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down. 
* Color-codes each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed. 
* Allows a user to enter an event when they click a time block.
* Saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.
* Persists events between refreshes of a page.
